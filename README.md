# Employee Churn Prediction 

This repository explores the development of a machine learning model to predict employee churn. The goal is to identify employees at risk of leaving the company, allowing HR to implement proactive retention strategies.

**Getting Started**

This project utilizes Python libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow (optional). 

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/employee-churn-prediction.git
```

2. Install required libraries (refer to requirements.txt for specific versions):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Project Structure**

**Analysis and Modeling**

The Jupyter notebook `employee_churn_analysis.ipynb` guides you through the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning and Exploration:**
    * Handling missing values and outliers
    * Exploratory data analysis to understand feature distributions and relationships with churn
2. **Modeling:**
    * Implementing and comparing machine learning models for churn prediction:
        * Logistic Regression
        * Random Forest Classifier
        * Dense Neural Network (optional)
    * Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance
3. **Evaluation:**
    * Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
    * Addressing imbalanced data (churn being the minority class) to improve recall
        * Techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) and cost-sensitive learning
4. **Future Work:**
    * Feature engineering for potentially better model performance
    * Exploring additional models and ensemble techniques
    * Model explainability for understanding churn prediction factors

**Future Considerations**

* Deploying the model for real-time employee churn scoring
* Integrating with HR processes for churn identification and intervention
* Continuously monitoring and retraining the model for long-term accuracy

**Additional Notes**

* Replace `churn_data.csv` in the `data` directory with your actual employee data file.
* Ensure your data is anonymized and adheres to privacy regulations.

**Feel free to contribute!**

We welcome pull requests and suggestions for improvement. Let's build a robust model to help companies retain their valuable employees.
